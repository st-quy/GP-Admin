It's different from the city, which is very busy and full of dust. Unfortunately, I am away this weekend so I cannot help with the cleaning. However, I know my brother and his friends will be very interested in this cleanup so I will ask them if they can help.\nSam\nI'm a very busy person and I have to spend this weekend with my family because I only have the weekend as free time. I think young people who don't have families should help. Besides, students and schools also have days off on weekends. I think this volunteering will be very helpful for students' future careers. \nPaul\nI think this volunteering is a good idea but it doesn't have a long-term vision. When volunteers clean up the park, it will be clean, but it will become busy again after about a month when tourist season arrives. I think we should clean this park regularly about once a month. Surrounding areas such as the lake and local forest should also be cleaned up. We should also have signs telling visitors to clean up their trash. I am very upset when I see a lot of trash on both sides of the road. \nLinda\nMy family and I often spend time at the park. My children love going to the park and they find the park a very interesting place to visit. My son has a dream of becoming a biologist so I think cleaning up this park will be very helpful for my son. I think we should pique children's interest in cleaning.

              "Content": "Early Australia\nParagraph 1 - The traditional view of Australia’s history begins with the arrival of British settlers in 1788, but Australia’s history started long before then. Indigenous Australians, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, have lived on the continent for over 65,000 years. They are believed to have migrated from Southeast Asia, possibly by navigating land bridges and seas. These early settlers developed rich cultures, languages, and strong connections to the land. Acknowledging this alternative history broadens our understanding of Australia’s past and highlights the significance of Indigenous contributions to the country’s heritage. \nParagraph 2 - Australia’s remote location and harsh environment created a natural barrier to early migration and settlement. Surrounded by vast oceans and featuring rugged terrain, deserts, and unique ecosystems, the continent was difficult to reach and explore. Early explorers and settlers faced limited water sources, extreme weather, and unfamiliar wildlife, which made survival challenging. Even after British settlers arrived, the harsh landscape slowed the spread of colonies across Australia. The land’s challenging conditions required people to adapt and develop special survival skills.\nParagraph 3 - Modern technology has provided tools to study the early migration routes to Australia. Underwater archaeology, sonar mapping, and satellite imaging have uncovered ancient sites and artifacts, offering clues about the pathways early humans took. These tools allow researchers to explore underwater regions that were once dry land, revealing potential routes and sites where early humans may have stopped along the way. Such discoveries are helping scientists understand more about how the first people arrived in Australia and the resources they used.\nParagraph 4 - Early migration to Australia was likely a long and challenging journey made in stages. Researchers believe that ancient people traveled from Southeast Asia to Australia by crossing islands, taking breaks between stages of their journey. Each stage would have involved adapting to new environments, finding food and water, and developing navigation skills. This gradual journey highlights the determination and resilience of early humans as they moved across unknown territories, ultimately reaching Australia. Such staged migration required planning, adaptability, and survival skills that helped them face the challenges of each new stage.\nParagraph 5 - Recent archaeological finds in Australia and Southeast Asia are leading scientists to speculate about early human arrival. Discoveries of ancient tools and fossils suggest humans might have arrived even earlier than previously thought. These findings push back the estimated timeline of human migration to Australia and raise questions about how early communities lived and traveled. Each new discovery helps form a clearer picture of the past, but also introduces new mysteries, allowing researchers to consider different theories and possibilities about the lives of these ancient travelers.\nParagraph 6 - European settlers arriving in Australia lacked the skills and knowledge to survive in its unique environment. Unlike Indigenous Australians, who had lived on the land for thousands of years and understood it well, the newcomers struggled to find food, water, and shelter. They were unfamiliar with the climate, wildlife, and local plants, which made survival difficult. Many settlers depended on Indigenous knowledge to learn how to live in the environment, but the initial lack of skills led to hardship and failed expeditions. This highlights the importance of understanding and respecting the local environment.\nParagraph 7 - Explorers have shown remarkable determination to map and understand Australia’s vast lands. Indigenous Australians journeyed across the continent, developing deep connections to the land, while European explorers in the 18th and 19th centuries were driven by curiosity and ambition. Explorers like James Cook, Matthew Flinders, and Burke and Wills took risks to explore unknown areas, often facing dangerous conditions. Their determination, though sometimes costly, paved the way for new settlements and trade. The spirit of exploration continues to inspire Australians to discover more about their unique land.",
